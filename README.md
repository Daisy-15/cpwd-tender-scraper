# cpwd-tender-scraper
A Python script that automates the extraction of tender data from the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) eTender website. It navigates to the "New Tenders" section, selects the "All" tab, scrapes details of the first 20 tenders, and saves the data in a CSV file with structured columns for easy analysis.
